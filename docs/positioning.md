# Positioning

## Core framing
- Decision receipt / decision ledger for SMB IT/Ops teams.
- “The Google Doc decision log that doesn’t fall apart.”
- “Never ask ‘who approved this?’ again.”

## What we are
- A lightweight decision receipt layer with a clean audit trail.
- A fast capture tool for decisions that already happen via tickets and email.

## What we are not
- Not a workflow engine.
- Not an ITIL/CAB replacement.
- Not a Jira/ITSM replacement.

## Language guidelines
- Use: decision receipt, decision ledger, audit trail, approver, owner, traceability.
- Avoid: governance workflow, CAB automation, ticket replacement.

## Email ritual alignment
- Subject format: “Decision – {Title}”.
- Body must include summary, context, and deep link.

## Proof points
- Faster than sending a decision email.
- Immutable audit trail with approver names and timestamps.
- Print-friendly view for retention.
